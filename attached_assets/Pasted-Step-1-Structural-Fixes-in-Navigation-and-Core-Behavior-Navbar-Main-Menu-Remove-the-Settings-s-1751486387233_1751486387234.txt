Step 1: Structural Fixes in Navigation and Core Behavior
Navbar/Main Menu:
Remove the "Settings" section from the side navbar.
Consolidate all sidebar options under "Main Menu."

Notifications & Alerts:
Rename all instances of "Alerts" to "Notifications" throughout the system.
Synchronize notification badges (correct count of unread) in the dashboard/header.
Fix: Marking a notification as read must persist (notification remains read even after page refresh).
Ensure the notifications button in the header accurately reflects the real-time status of messages.

Step 2: Advanced Data Generation
Data Generator:
Extend data generator to create monthly incomes (up to the current month).
Generate monthly expenses per account/card.
For credit cards: assign realistic limits, invoice values, installments (parcelamentos), recurring/fixed payments, and credit purchases.
Prevent negative values in incomes/balances (only allow negatives for expenses/spending).
Generate sample cases for overdue, due soon, and future due invoices.
Ensure all relevant credit card data fields are complete and consistent.

Step 3: Filters and Search Functionality
Accounts & Cards Page:
Implement fully functional, independent filter systems for bank accounts and credit cards.
Add an "Apply Filters" button for each module.

Income & Expenses Page:
Convert all search bars to use dynamic autocomplete (live search based on available data).

Step 4: UX/UI and User Feedback
Toasts & Notifications:
All system echo/log/print messages and confirmations should display via the Toast Notify system, never via browser alerts.

Global Scrollbar:
Implement a stylish, custom global scrollbar consistent with the appâ€™s visual identity.

Step 5: Tables and Data Organization
Pagination & Column Management:
Add pagination to all system tables.
Provide options in all tables for users to configure visible columns and column order (show/hide and reorder).

Step 6: Invoice Functionality Enhancements
Invoices Page:
Enable "view details" functionality on the lucide-eye buttons.
Remove the download button next to the view button.
Implement the "analysis" button functionality (next to the view icon).
Step 7: Category Visual and Functional Improvements
Categories Page:
Enhance the category visuals: use custom icons (Font Awesome or more complete library).
Provide a broad selection of icons for category creation/editing dialogs.
Add support for subcategories.
Add options for expense types: fixed, variable, recurring, etc.
Step 8: Mobile Responsiveness and Fixes
Mobile-first & Responsiveness:
Fix any visible issues with responsiveness, especially in tables (e.g., invoice tables with "All", "Overdue", "Due Soon" tabs).
Review and fix similar problems on other pages and modules.
