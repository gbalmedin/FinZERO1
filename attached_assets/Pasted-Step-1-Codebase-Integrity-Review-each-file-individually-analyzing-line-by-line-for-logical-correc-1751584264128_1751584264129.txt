Step 1: Codebase Integrity

Review each file individually, analyzing line-by-line for logical correctness, syntactic accuracy, and adherence to best practices.

Validate imports and module dependencies, ensuring all dependencies are installed and correctly versioned.

Check for unused variables, functions, or redundant code and flag them explicitly.

Step 2: Functional Validation

Validate every function separately, ensuring all inputs produce expected outputs and handle edge cases appropriately.

Ensure robust error handling is implemented across the entire application with meaningful error messages.

Verify that APIs, database connections, and external services are reliably integrated and respond correctly.

Step 3: User Interface and User Experience

Thoroughly test the UI/UX across different devices and screen sizes, confirming responsive design.

Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, forms, dropdowns, modals, etc.) function perfectly and provide immediate, correct feedback.

Check navigation flows for logical consistency, intuitive paths, and absence of dead ends or broken links.

Step 4: Performance and Optimization

Validate the application's loading and response times, noting any delays or inefficiencies.

Ensure optimized database queries, efficient looping structures, and minimized resource usage.

Check for memory leaks or performance bottlenecks and document precisely where issues occur.

Step 5: Security and Compliance

Conduct security checks to verify protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection, Authentication Bypasses).

Validate user input sanitization rigorously across all input fields.

Confirm proper management of sensitive data, ensuring encryption where necessary and secure storage.

Step 6: Documentation and Maintainability

Review comments and documentation within the code for clarity, accuracy, and comprehensiveness.

Identify and recommend necessary improvements or additional documentation needed for future maintainability.

Ensure README files or equivalent documentation provide clear, step-by-step setup and deployment instructions.

Step 7: Environment and Deployment

Verify that the applicationâ€™s deployment environment on Replit is correctly configured.

Test deployment scripts, environment variables, and configuration files thoroughly.

Document detailed steps required for reproducible builds and deployments.
